Write a Java application that determines if pairs of words and phrases stored in a text file areanagrams. 
An anagram is a rearrangement of the letters in either a word or phrase to form a differentword or phrase. 
Each letter in the original word or phrase is used exactly once to create the new wordor phrase. 
Some examples of anagrams are: “rescue” and “secure,” “debit card” and “bad credit,” and“Eric Clapton” and “narcoleptic.” 
The file “AnagramPairs.txt” contains 55 pairs of anagrams. Foradditional anagrams, visit The Wordplay Web Site and click on the Anagrams link (http://www.funwith-words.com/anagrams.html).
This site is the source for the anagrams in the text file.
